# Change Log

All notable changes to the "cursor-stats" extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.6] - 2025-07-20

### Fixed
- 🚨 **CRITICAL: Team Spend Data Display**: Fixed missing usage spend data for team members
  - Extension was not extracting or displaying `spendCents` from team spend API response
  - Added `spendCents` to TypeScript interfaces and data extraction logic
  - Team members now see actual current usage (e.g., $4.54) instead of "No usage recorded"
- 📅 **Billing Cycle Synchronization**: Fixed incorrect usage-based pricing dates
  - Removed hardcoded assumption that usage-based pricing starts on 3rd of each month
  - Now uses actual `subscriptionCycleStart` from API data (matches premium request cycle)
  - Both premium requests and usage-based pricing now show synchronized dates (e.g., "25 June - 25 July")
- 🎯 **Personal vs Team Usage Display**: Enhanced team member usage presentation
  - Shows personal limit and percentage (e.g., $4.54/$100 = 4.5%) 
  - Shows team contribution percentage (e.g., $4.54/$500 = 0.9%)
  - Progress bars now reflect personal usage percentage instead of team percentage
  - Fixed floating point precision issues in percentage display
- 🔧 **Month Selection Logic**: Fixed incorrect month selection for team spend data
  - Team spend data now correctly uses current month instead of falling back to previous month
  - Ensures usage-based pricing dates match premium request dates
- 💼 **Team Spend Messaging**: Replaced "No usage recorded" with proper team spend data display
  - Shows "Team Spend data: $X.XX current usage" when detailed breakdown unavailable

## [1.1.5] - 2025-07-03

### Added
- 🔄 **Hybrid Data Collection**: Smart combination of team spend and individual usage APIs for comprehensive statistics
- 📊 **Enhanced Model Breakdown**: Detailed tooltip showing usage across all AI models with proper labeling
  - GPT-4 (Premium/Fast): Fast premium requests
  - GPT-4-32k (Usage-Based): Usage-based spending limit  
  - GPT-3.5-turbo: Legacy model
- 🔍 **Team vs Individual Comparison**: Clear distinction between team usage and individual usage for team members
- 🎯 **Improved API Logic**: Better understanding of usage-based spending limits from GPT-4-32k data

### Changed
- 🔧 **API Endpoint Migration**: Replaced deprecated `get-team-usage` with `get-team-spend` endpoint
- 📈 **Data Source Priority**: Team members now get team-specific usage data while maintaining individual context
- 💡 **Usage-Based Limit Detection**: GPT-4-32k `maxRequestUsage` now properly represents usage-based spending limits
- 🏷️ **Model Labeling**: Enhanced model names with descriptive labels for better user understanding
- 🔄 **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatic fallback to individual usage API if team APIs fail

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Missing Request Limits**: Resolved issue where team spend data lacked `maxRequestUsage` by combining with individual usage API
- 🎯 **Data Accuracy**: Improved accuracy for team members by using team-specific usage data
- 📊 **Status Bar Display**: Better alignment between dashboard data and extension display
- 🔧 **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for API endpoint transitions
- 🚨 **CRITICAL: Usage-Based Pricing Detection**: Fixed inconsistent usage-based pricing status detection for team members
  - Backend correctly detected team usage-based pricing as enabled
  - UI tooltip incorrectly showed "disabled" due to missing team context
  - Fixed by ensuring tooltip uses team-aware API calls with proper teamId parameter
  - Resolves issue where $250 usage-based pricing showed as "disabled" in tooltip despite being active

## [1.1.3] - 2024-07-27

### Fixed
- 🐛 Fixed an issue where some users could not retrieve their access token after the `v1.1.2` update due to the new SQLite library.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-05-23

- 🚀 Changelog Display on Update: The extension now automatically shows the changelog in a webview panel when it's updated to a new version.

### Changed

- 🛠 Refined detection and notification logic for unknown AI models in usage data.
- ⚙️ Spending alert notifications are now reset and re-evaluated if the `spendingAlertThreshold` setting is changed.
